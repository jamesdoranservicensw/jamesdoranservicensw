                        <p>Our sovereign wealth fund, the NSW Generations Fund (NGF), continues to grow. <br></br>
                            Seeded with an initial investment of $10 billion in late 2019, the NGF was valued at $10.9 billion at 30 June 2020, and is projected to grow to more than $30 billion over the next decade. This initiative will help lower the debt burden for future generations. <br></br>
                            Since the Budget, the Government has directed nearly $300 million extra into the NGF. The first community project funded by the NSW Generations fund was My Community Project.<br></br>
                            The fund helps keep the state’s debt at a sustainable level, while sharing the benefits of its returns with the people of NSW by funding community projects.<br></br>

                        Successful projects align with one or more of the five program categories :
